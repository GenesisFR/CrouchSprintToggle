# CrouchSprintToggle
An AutoHotkey 1.1 script that converts your CTRL/SHIFT keys into toggle keys so that you don't have to hold them to crouch or sprint in games. Both keys are mutually exclusive.

## Installation:

You can run the script from anywhere. Make sure "CrouchSprintToggle.ini" is in the same directory.

## Usage:

Please read "CrouchSprintToggle.ini" for more information about setting up the script.

Shift: toggle sprint  
Left CTRL: toggle crouch  
Left CTRL + F12: pause the script (disable all hotkeys)
