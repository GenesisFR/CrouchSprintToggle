# CrouchSprintToggle
An AutoHotkey 1.1 script that converts your CTRL/SHIFT keys and right-click into toggle keys so that you don't have to hold them to crouch, sprint or aim in games. CTRL/SHIFT are mutually exclusive.

## Installation:

You can run the script from anywhere as long as "HoldToggles.ini" is in the same directory than the script.
Make sure that CTRL, SHIFT and right-click are bound in the game to crouch, sprint and aim.

## Usage:

Please read "HoldToggles.ini" for more information about setting up the script.

Right-click: toggle aim  
Left CTRL: toggle crouch  
Shift: toggle sprint  
Left CTRL + F12: pause the script (disable all hotkeys)
