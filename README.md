# HoldToggles
An AutoHotkey 1.1 script that converts your CTRL/SHIFT keys and right-click into toggle keys so that you don't have to hold them to crouch, sprint or aim in games. CTRL/SHIFT are mutually exclusive.

## Installation

You can run the script from anywhere as long as "HoldToggles.ini" is in the same directory than the script.  
Make sure that CTRL, SHIFT and right-click are bound in the game to crouch, sprint and aim.

## Usage

The script will only be active when the game's window is in focus. Please read "HoldToggles.ini" for more information about setting up the script.

Left CTRL: toggle crouch  
SHIFT: toggle sprint  
Right-click: toggle aim  
Left CTRL + F12: pause the script (disable all hotkeys)  

For games run as admin, you must also run the script as admin for it to work.

## Limitations

I've only tested the script in Half-Life 2 and Unity games.  
It will not work in games that prevent keys from being simulated (ex: games using anti-cheats).
