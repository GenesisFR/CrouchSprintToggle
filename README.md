# CrouchSprintToggle
An AutoHotkey 1.1 script that converts your CTRL/SHIFT keys into toggle keys so that you don't have to hold them to crouch or sprint in games. Both keys are mutually exclusive.

## Installation:

You can run the script from anywhere.

## Usage:

Escape: save toggle states, restore them when pressed again (useful in menus)
Shift: toggle sprint
Left CTRL: toggle crouch
Left CTRL + F12: pause the script (disable all hotkeys)
Windows: disable all toggles
Left Alt: disable all toggles
