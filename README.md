# KeyToggles
An AutoHotkey 1.1 script that makes keys and mouse buttons togglable so that you don't have to hold them to crouch, sprint or aim in games.

## Installation

You can run the script from anywhere as long as "KeyToggles.ini" is in the same directory than the script.  

## Usage

The script will only be active when the game's window is in focus. Please read "KeyToggles.ini" for more information about setting it up.  
Make sure that your keys or mouse buttons in "KeyToggles.ini" are the same than the ones in the game.

Default keys:

Left CTRL: toggle crouch  
Left SHIFT: toggle sprint  
Right-click: toggle aim  
Left ALT + F12: pause the script (disable all hotkeys)  

For games run as admin, you must also run the script as admin for it to work.

## Limitations

I've only tested the script in Half-Life 1, Half-Life 2 and Unity games.  
It will not work in games that prevent keys from being simulated (ex: games using anti-cheats).
